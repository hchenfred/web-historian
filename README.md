#web-historian
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
This is a clone of http://archive.org, a web service that archives sites on the internet. 
We practiced on
# Build a client/server model, use native node.js to write the server end
# Handle RESTFUL requests
# Use CRON a time-based job scheduler to schedule background jobs
# Use callback functions and promises
